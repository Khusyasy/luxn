# Luxn.js

I'm "recreating" [Alpine.js](https://alpinejs.dev/) from scratch for ~~educational~~ recreational purpose!

I have deliberately not looked at any of their source code so I can find all the problems in implementing a simple, lightweight, javascript framework.

Luxn.js name is from lux (latin meaning light) + n, so luxn means **lightn fast!!!**

## Features

Every features is directly used in html by adding `data-*` attribute to the element as shown below, which would still be changing so it doesnt mean much.

Only the `data-*` attribute is used so all website created using this framework would still be a valid html, which probably doesnt even matter now, so idk lol.

- `data-app`
- `data-text`
- `data-html`
- `data-model`
- `data-for`
- `data-on:[event]`
- `data-bind:[attribute]`

For more detail see `examples` folder.
